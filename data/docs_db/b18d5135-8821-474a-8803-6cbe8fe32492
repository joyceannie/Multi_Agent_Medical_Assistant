## What is a brain tumor?

hat starts in the brain and usually does not spread o other parts of the body. Primary brain tumors A primary brain tumor is an abnormal growth t t may be benign or malignant.

A benign brain tumor grows slowly, has distinct boundaries, and rarely spreads. Although its cells are not malignant, this tumor composed of benign cells and located in vital areas can be considered life-threatening.
