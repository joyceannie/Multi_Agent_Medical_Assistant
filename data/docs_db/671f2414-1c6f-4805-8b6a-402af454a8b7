## Metastatic (secondary) brain tumors begin as

cancer elsewhere in the body and spread to the brain. They form when cancer cells are carried in the blood stream to the brain. The most common cancers that spread to the brain are lung and breast.

Figure 1. Brain tumors compress and displace normal brain tissue. Increasing size, pressure and swelling cause neurologic symptoms.

picture_counter_2 The image is a labeled diagram of a cross-section of the human head, illustrating a brain hemorrhage. It shows the brain compressed and displaced due to mass effect, with labels pointing to the skull, dura, and the area of hemorrhage. The hemorrhage is depicted in red, located in the right hemisphere, causing compression of arteries and nerves. The diagram is from Mayfield Clinic.

Whether a brain tumor is benign, malignant, or metastatic, all are potentially life-threatening. Enclosed within the bony skull, the brain cannot expand to make room for a growing mass. As a result, the tumor compresses and displaces normal brain tissue (Fig. 1). Some brain tumors cause a blockage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that flows around and through the brain. This blockage increases intracranial pressure and can enlarge the ventricles (hydrocephalus). Some brain tumors cause swelling (edema). Size, pressure, and swelling all create "mass effect," which cause many of the symptoms.


## Types of brain tumors

There are over 120 different types of brain tumors. Common brain tumors include:


## Gliomas

- · Astrocytoma
- o Pilocytic Astrocytoma (grade I)
- o Diffuse Astrocytoma (grade II)
- o Anaplastic Astrocytoma (grade III)
- o Glioblastoma Multiforme (grade IV)
- · Oligodendroglioma (grade II)
- o Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma (grade III)
- Anaplastic Ependymoma (grade III)
- · Ependymoma (grade II) o

Meningioma

Schwannoma (neuroma)

Pituitary adenoma

Pinealoma (pineocytoma, pineoblastoma)

Medulloblastoma

he World Health Organization (WHO) developed a lassification and grading system to standardize ommunication, treatment planning, and predict utcomes for brain tumors. Tumors are classified by heir cell type and grade by viewing the cells, sually taken during a biopsy, under a microscope. T c c o t u

- · Cell type. Refers to the cell of origin of the tumor. For example, nerve cells (neurons) and support cells (glial and schwann cells) give rise to tumors. About half of all primary brain tumors grow from glial cells (gliomas). There are many types of gliomas because there are different kinds of glial cells.
- · Grade . Refers to the way tumor cells look under the microscope and is an indication of aggressiveness (e.g., low grade means least aggressive and high grade means most aggressive) (Table 1). Tumors often have a mix of cell grades and can change as they grow. Differentiated and anaplastic are terms used to describe how similar or abnormal the tumor cells appear compared to normal cells.


## Table 1. Glioma Grading Scale.

| Grade   | Characteristics                                                                                                                               |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## What causes brain tumors?

Medical science neither knows what causes brain tumors nor how to prevent primary tumors that start in the brain. People most at risk for brain tumors include those who have:

- · cancer elsewhere in the body
- · prolonged exposure to pesticides, industrial solvents, and other chemicals
- · inherited diseases, such as neurofibromatosis

Figure 2. Brain tumor symptoms are related to the functional areas of the brain, giving doctors clues as to the tumor location.

## What are the symptoms?

umors can affect the brain by destroying normal issue, compressing normal tissue, or increasing ntracranial pressure. Symptoms vary depending on he tumor's type, size, and location in the brain Fig. 2). General symptoms include: T t i t (

- · headaches that tend to worsen in the morning
- · seizures
- · stumbling, dizziness, difficulty walking
- · speech problems (e.g., difficulty finding the right word)
- · vision problems, abnormal eye movements
- · weakness on one side of the body
- · increased intracranial pressure, which causes drowsiness, headaches, nausea and vomiting, sluggish responses


## Who is affected?

The American Brain Tumor Association estimates that about 40,900 people will be diagnosed with a primary brain tumor in the US this year (rate of 14 per 100,000 people). Metastatic (secondary) brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors by at least 10 to 1, and they occur in 20% to 40% of cancer patients. The exact number of brain metastases is unknown, but it has been estimated that 98,000 to 170,000 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year. Unfortunately, each year about 12,690 people die of brain tumors in the US. Although brain tumors can occur at any age, they are most common in children 3 to 12 years old and in adults 40 to 70 years old.


## How is a diagnosis made?

First, the doctor will obtain your personal and family medical history and perform a complete physical examination. In addition to checking your general health, the doctor performs a neurological exam to check mental status and memory, cranial nerve function (sight, hearing, smell, tongue and facial movement), muscle strength, coordination, reflexes, and response to pain. Additional tests may include:

- · Audiometry, a hearing test performed by an audiologist, detects hearing loss due to tumors near the cochlear nerve (e.g., acoustic neuroma).
- · An endocrine evaluation measures hormone levels in your blood or urine to detect abnormal levels caused by pituitary tumors (e.g., Cushing's Disease).
- · A visual field acuity test is performed by a neuro-ophthalmologist to detect vision loss and missing areas in your field of view.
- · A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) may be performed to examine cerebrospinal fluid for tumor cells, proteins, infection, and blood.

picture_counter_4 The image shows two brain scan images, one on the left and one on the right. The left scan appears to be a CT scan displaying a large, rounded, hypodense lesion in the brain's right hemisphere. The right scan appears to be an MRI showing a large, irregularly shaped, hyperintense lesion with surrounding edema. Both images are related to medical diagnosis, likely illustrating different imaging modalities for brain pathology.

Benign

Malignant

Figure 3. MRI scans of a benign and malignant brain tumor. Benign tumors have well defined edges and are more easily removed surgically. Malignant tumors have an irregular border that invades normal tissue with finger-like projections making surgical removal more difficult.


## Imaging tests

- · Computed Tomography (CT) scan is a safe, noninvasive test that uses an X-ray beam and a computer to make 2-dimensional images of the brain. Similar to an MRI, it views the brain in slices, layer-by-layer, taking a picture of each slice. A dye (contrast agent) may be injected into your bloodstream. CT is especially useful for viewing changes in bony structures.
- · Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan is a noninvasive test that uses a magnetic field and radiofrequency waves to give a detailed view of the soft tissues of the brain. It views the brain 3-dimensionally in slices that can be taken from the side or from the top as a crosssection. A dye (contrast agent) may be injected into your bloodstream. MRI is very useful to evaluate brain lesions and their effects on surrounding brain (Fig. 3).


## Biopsy

In some cases, if a diagnosis cannot be made clearly from the scans, a biopsy may be performed to determine what type of tumor is present. Biopsy is a procedure to remove a small amount of tumor to be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. A biopsy can be taken as part of an open surgical procedure to remove the tumor or as a separate diagnostic procedure, known as a needle biopsy via a small hole drilled in the skull. A hollow needle is guided into the tumor and a tissue sample is removed (Fig. 4). A stereotactic biopsy is like a needle biopsy but is performed with the use of a stereotactic head frame and a computer to precisely locate the tumor and direct the needle. This more complex procedure is used for deep tumors in critical locations.

## Who treats brain tumors?

Because there are so many kinds of brain tumors and some are complex to treat, many doctors may be involved in your care. Your team may include a neurosurgeon, oncologist, radiation oncologist, radiologist, neurologist, and neuro-ophthalmologist.


## What treatments are available?

Treatment options vary depending on the type, grade, size and location of the tumor; whether it has spread; and your age and general health. The goal of treatment may be curative or focus on relieving symptoms (palliative care). Treatments are often used in combination with one another. The goal is to remove all or as much of the tumor as possible through surgery to minimize the chance of recurrence. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are used to treat tumors that cannot be removed by surgery alone. For example, surgery may remove the bulk of the tumor and a small amount of residual tumor near a critical structure can later be treated with radiation.


## Observation

Sometimes the best treatment is observation. For example, benign, slow growing tumors that are small and have few symptoms may be observed with routine MRI scans every year until their growth or symptoms necessitate surgery. Observation may be the best option for older patients with other health conditions.


## Medication

Medications are used to control some of the common side effects of brain tumors.

- · Corticosteroid medications, such as dexamethasone (Decadron), are prescribed to reduce swelling and inflammation around the tumor. Because steroid medications can cause stomach ulcers and gastric reflux, famotidine (Pepcid) or pantoprazole (Protonix) are prescribed to reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach.
- · Furosemide (Lasix) or mannitol (Osmitrol) may be used to control edema and intracranial pressure.
- · Anticonvulsant medications are used to prevent or control seizures. The most common ones include phenytoin (Dilantin), valproic acid (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and levetiracetam (Keppra).


## Surgery

Surgery is the treatment of choice for brain tumors that can be reached without causing significant injury to vital parts of the brain (eloquent tissue). Surgery can help to refine the diagnosis, remove as much of the tumor as possible, and release pressure within the skull caused by the tumor. A neurosurgeon performs a craniotomy to open the

Figure 4. During a needle biopsy, a hollow cannula is inserted into the tumor. Small biting instruments remove bits of tumor for the pathologist to examine and determine the exact tumor cell type.

It includes a diagram of a hand holding a syringe and needle, inserting into a cross-sectional view of the brain. There are three smaller illustrations in the top left corner depicting different stages of needle insertion into a test tube or container. The diagram is detailed with anatomical features of the brain, such as the ventricles and surrounding tissue.

skull and remove the tumor. Sometimes only part of the tumor is removed if it is near critical areas of the brain. A partial removal can still relieve symptoms. Radiation or chemotherapy may be used on the remaining tumor cells.

Improvements in techniques, particularly imageguided surgery, intraoperative MRI/CT, and functional brain mapping have improved the surgeon's ability to precisely locate the tumor, define the tumor's borders, avoid injury to vital brain areas, and confirm the amount of tumor removal while in the operating room.


## Radiation

at brain tumors. Radiation works by damaging Radiation therapy uses controlled high-energy rays to tre the DNA inside cells making them unable to divide and reproduce. The goal of radiation therapy is to maximize the dose to abnormal cells and minimize exposure to normal cells (Fig. 5). The benefits of radiation are not immediate but occur over time. Aggressive tumors, whose cells divide rapidly, typically respond more quickly to radiation. There are two ways to deliver radiation, external and internal beams.

<!-- page_break -->

xternal beam radiation is delivered from outside he body by a machine that aims high-energy rays x-rays, gamma rays) at the tumor. E t (

- · Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) delivers a high dose of radiation during a single session. Although it is called surgery, no incision is made.
- · Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSR) delivers lower doses of radiation over many visits. Patients return daily over several weeks to receive the complete radiation dose.
- · Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) delivers the radiation dose to the entire brain. It is often used to treat multiple brain tumors and metastases.

Internal radiation (brachytherapy) is delivered from nside the body by surgically placing radioactive material (sealed in catheters, seeds, or balloons) irectly into the tumor. After the patient undergoes a craniotomy to remove the tumor, the radioactive material is placed inside the tumor cavity. The radiation dose is delivered to the first few millimeters of tissue that surrounded the tumor avity where malignant cells may still remain. Patients have no risk of radiation injury to other parts of their own body or to others around them because the radiation dose is precisely delivered and short lived. i d c


## Chemotherapy

hemotherapy drugs work by interrupting cell division. However, it affects not only tumor cells but ormal cells, thus causing side effects, especially in ast growing cells (e.g., hair, digestive, blood). reatment is delivered in cycles with rest periods in etween to allow the body to rebuild healthy cells. hemotherapy drugs can be administered orally as pill, intravenously (IV), or as a wafer placed urgically into the tumor. The drugs most ommonly used to treat brain tumors are armustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), and emozolomide (Temodar). Chemotherapy is also sed as a radio-sensitizing agent that increases umor cell death during radiation therapy. Agents hat often work in high-grade gliomas include rocarbazine, platinum analogs (cisplatin, arboplatin), the nitrosureas (BCNU, CCNU), and lkylating agents (temozolomide, vincristine). BCNU as been proven effective when applied locally to he tumor bed after the tumor has been removed. y applying it directly to the diseased area of the rain, side effects are limited and the drug has a outinely used for benign tumors. C n f T b C a s c c t u t t p c a h t B b more beneficial effect. Chemotherapy is not r


## Adjunct therapies

- · Immunotherapy or biotherapy activates the immune system (T-cells and antibodies) to destroy cancer cells. Experimental research is exploring ways to prevent or treat cancer through vaccines.
- · Gene therapy uses viruses or other vectors to introduce new genetic material into tumor cells. This experimental therapy can cause tumor cells to die or increase their susceptibility to other cancer therapies.
- · Hyperbaric oxygen uses oxygen at higher than normal levels to promote wound healing and help fight infection. It may also improve the tumor's responsiveness to radiation and is being studied experimentally. Currently it is being used to help the body naturally remove dead tumor cells and treat radiation necrosis.

picture_counter_6 The image is a medical scan, likely an MRI or CT, showing a cross-sectional view of the brain. There are multiple colored lines and markers indicating targeted regions, with a focus on a specific area outlined in pink. A small yellow dot is present within the targeted region, and a color legend on the bottom right displays dose levels in Gray (Gy), ranging from 9.00 Gy to 32.00 Gy, with corresponding color codes. The image also includes a small icon of a brain with a radiation symbol in the lower left corner.


## Clinical trials

Clinical trials are research studies in which new treatments-drugs, diagnostics, procedures, and other therapies-are tested in people to see if they are safe and effective. Research is always being conducted to improve the standard of medical care. Information about current clinical trials, including eligibility, protocol, and locations, are found on the Web. Studies can be sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (see clinicaltrials.gov) as well as private industry and pharmaceutical companies (see www.centerwatch.com).


## Recovery &amp; prevention


## Self care

Your primary care doctor and oncologist should discuss any home care needs with you and your family. Supportive measures vary according to your symptoms. For example, canes or walkers can help those having trouble walking. A plan of care to address changes in mental status should be adapted to each patient's needs.

## Recurrence

How well a tumor will respond to treatment, remain in remission, or recur after treatment depends on the specific tumor type and location. A recurrent tumor may be a tumor that still persists after treatment, one that grows back some time after treatment destroyed it, or a new tumor that grows in the same place as the original one.

When a brain tumor is in remission, the tumor cells have stopped growing or multiplying. Periods of remission vary. In general, benign tumors recur less often than malignant ones.

Since it is impossible to predict whether or when a particular tumor may recur, lifelong monitoring with MRI or CT scans is essential for people treated for a brain tumor, even a benign lesion. Follow-up scans may be performed every 3 to 6 months or annually, depending on the type of tumor you had.
